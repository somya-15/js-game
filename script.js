  // Defining these canvas properties here outside the class because this class will only run once on the initial page load. We can't always do that if we have multiple objects of different fill styles and stroke colours. In that case we would have to define these properties inside the draw method and switch between them again and again (depending on the object we are drawing). The problem with that is that the method will be called 60 times per second and change in canvas state like this could get performance expensive. Hence its a good idea to structure in a way where we change the canvas state as little as possible.

But using JS modules would require us to run this code through a local server (npm jhamela), i.e. It wouldn't run the code by simply opening HTML file in the browser anymoreðŸ˜¬

      // since the character images can have different shapes and sizes, we need to define the hitbox of the character. Hitbox is the area of the character that can be hit by other objects in the game. We can define the hitbox by defining the x and y coordinates of a the center of a circular shadow below the character. The radius of the circle is the radius of the hitbox.

      // To limit certain canvas settings only to a specific draw calls we wrap the drawing code between 'save()' and 'restore()' built-in canvas methods.

      context.save(); // save() method creates a snapshot of the current canvas state, including fillStyle, lineWidth, opacity (globalAlpha) as well as transformations and scaling
      // now we can do any changes to the canvas state we want
      context.globalAlpha = 0.5;
      // the will call will get affected by the changed opacity
      context.fill(); // to fill the shape with color
      context.restore(); // restore() method restores the canvas state to the state it was in when the associated save() method was called. So the opacity will be reset to 1 again
      // hence stroke() will be drawn with full opacity
      context.stroke(); // to draw the outline of the shape

      // Therefore, save( ) and restore() methods allow us to apply specific drawing settings only to selected shapes, without affecting the rest of our canvas drawings.

The problem with this is that the speed is not constant. Player moves very fast at first because 1/20th of the distance is at first a big chunk when they are far apart but as they get closer 1/20th of the distance becomes smaller and smaller amount of pixels to be traveled per animation frame.

      // 2. We want the player to more at a constant speed. We have dx and dy. We want to calculate the distance between these 2 points (current mouse position and the player position).
